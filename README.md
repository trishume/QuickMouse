QuickMouse
==========

O(log9(N)) keyboard mouse for OSX that uses the Numpad. Written in MacRuby.

When you press `Numpad0` it displays a grid on your screen with 9 rectangles and a dot in the center.
By pressing numpad keys you can narrow the grid down. 
When the dot is on the place you want to click, press `NumpadEnter` for left click and `Numpad+` for right.
You can press `Numpad.` to cancel.

As a shortcut pressing any of the numbers before `Numpad0` displays the grid narrowed to that area without showing the full screen grid.
